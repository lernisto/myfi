Software supporting financial intelligence for individuals and families.

I know I should just use GNUCash or something like that, but I wouldn't learn
nearly as much that way.  Besides, the bookkeeping part is boring. The interesting
part is making the gazelle-debt-snowball work so people can focus on breaking
the chains of debt and achieving financial freedom. GNUcash is neutral on
borrowing, and all of the commercial programs actively promote taking on more
debt. (I am talking about You, mint.com. Blech!)
